# Description
This repository is for studying HTML5 Professional Certification Level 1.

# Goal
To Finish all courses of the certification, and to take the exam on 2024 Dec.

## Commit rules
1. As soon as possible, do commit every day even though I didn't study for a long time. STEADY is the best way to achieve goals!
2. Every commit would be started with the date.  
ex) `git commit -m "[20241020]Feat: add memos about root elements."`
3. I will create some websites as soon as possible based on the theories I've learned.
